# 🚀 E-commerce Analytics Pipeline

Welcome to your data engineering project! The goal is to simulate a real-world commercial task by building a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

You will be responsible for designing, building, and running a Python application that reads data from multiple sources (files and a database), processes it, and generates a final analysis report.

This project will challenge you to apply everything you've learned about **Python**, **OOP**, **SOLID**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## 🎯 Core Concepts to Apply

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** You will build a modular application using classes.
- **SOLID Principles:** Your code should be maintainable and extensible.
- **Pandas:** For loading, merging, and aggregating the data.
- **NumPy:** For efficient, vectorized numerical calculations.
- **PostgreSQL:** For connecting to, and reading from, a relational database.
- **Pydantic Settings:** For settings handling, using .env file for settings.

## 📖 The Task: Your Scenario

You are a data engineer at a new e-commerce company. Your data is fragmented:

1.  **Business Data:** Your company's `product` catalog and `customer` information live in a production **PostgreSQL** database.
2.  **Event Data:** All user activity (clicks, purchases) is dumped as JSON event logs into a complex, nested zip file structure.

**Your mission:** Create an automated pipeline that will be runnned daily. It must read all the event data, enrich it with data from the database, and produce a final CSV report summarizing sales performance by product category and customer segment.

## 🗃️ The Data Sources

You will be working with two distinct data sources.

### 1. File System: Event Logs

You must generate this data using the `data_generator.py` script.

- **Structure:** The script creates master zip files (e.g., `data/events_week_42.zip`).
- **Nesting:**
  - Inside the master zip are **daily zip files** (e.g., `events_2023-10-23.zip`).
  - Inside each daily zip are **JSON part-files** (e.g., `part-001.json`).
- **Event JSON Format:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "customer_id": "c123",
      "event_type": "view_product",
      "product_id": "p789"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "customer_id": "c456",
      "event_type": "purchase",
      "product_id": "p101",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
  ```

### 2. PostgreSQL Database

You will run a Docker container that automatically creates and populates this database using the `sql/init.sql` script.

- **`customers` table:** Contains information on all 100 customers.
  | customer_id | join_date | segment |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | c001 | 2024-12-05 | Regular |
  | c002 | 2025-07-21 | VIP |
  | ... | ... | ... |
  | c100 | 2025-03-14 | New |

- **`products` table:** Contains information on all 50 products.
  | product_id | product_name | category | price |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | p001 | Product Gamma 1 | Electronics | 149.99 |
  | p002 | Product Alpha 2 | Books | 24.50 |
  | ... | ... | ... | ... |
  | p050 | Product Delta 50 | Electronics | 299.95 |

## 🛠️ 🐧 Setup: How to Get Started (Linux)

Follow these steps to set up your environment.

### Step 1: Set up the Python Environment

Let's create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Synchronize packages via uv
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment if needed
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Start the Database

This project uses Docker to run the PostgreSQL database. The `docker-compose.yml` file is already configured.

```bash
# This command will start the database in the background.
# It will automatically find the `sql/init.sql` file and
# run it to create your tables and data.

docker compose up -d
```

Your database is now running. You can connect to it with these credentials:

- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `5432`
- **User:** `myuser`
- **Password:** `mypassword`
- **Database:** `ecommerce_db`

### Step 3: Generate the Event Data

Now, run the Python script to generate the raw event logs.

```bash
# This will create 50 weekly archives in a new 'data/' folder
python data_generator.py -c 50
```

## 🛠️ 🪟 Setup: How to Get Started (Windows)

Follow these steps to set up your environment on Windows.

Important: Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running before you start.

### Step 1: Set up the Python Environment

Open your terminal (Command Prompt) to set up the uv environment.

```bash
# Synchronize packages via uv
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment if needed
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Or .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 for powershell
```

### Step 2: Start the Database

This project uses Docker to run the PostgreSQL database. The `docker-compose.yml` file is already configured.

```bash
# This command will start the database in the background.
# It will automatically find the `sql/init.sql` file and
# run it to create your tables and data.

docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Generate the Event Data

Now, run the Python script to generate the raw event logs.

```bash
# This will create 50 weekly archives in a new 'data/' folder
python data_generator.py -c 50
```

_You are now ready to build! Good luck =)_

## 📋 Your Mission: The Pipeline

Your main task is to create the core pipeline logic (e.g., in a `pipeline/` directory). Your pipeline must perform these **Extract**, **Transform** and **Load** steps:

1. **Extract (Files):** Create a class that can navigate the nested zip structure (`data/*.zip` -> `*.zip` -> `*.json`) and load all events into a single Pandas DataFrame. Also add functionality for **batch processing** for weak machines.
2. **Extract (DB):** Create a class that connects to the PostgreSQL database and loads the `customers` and `products` tables into two separate DataFrames (hint: use `pd.read_sql`).
3. **Transform:**

- Filter the events DataFrame to get **only** `purchase` events.
- **Join** the `purchase` events with the `products` DataFrame on `product_id`.
- **Join** the result with the `customers` DataFrame on `customer_id`.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create a new column `total_revenue` = `quantity` \* `price`.
- **Aggregate:** `groupby()` the DataFrame by `category` and `customer_segment`.
- **Count:** Calculate the `sum` of `total_revenue`, `sum` of `quantity` (as `units_sold`), and the `nunique` (count distinct) of `customer_id`.

4. **Load:** Save this final, aggregated DataFrame to a new file (e.g., `reports/sales_report.csv`).

## 🏁 Final Report (The Target)

| category    | customer_segment | total_revenue | units_sold | unique_customers |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------------- |
| Electronics | VIP              | 14999.50      | 120        | 45               |
| Electronics | New              | 8500.00       | 70         | 60               |
| Clothing    | Regular          | 5200.25       | 210        | 115              |
| Books       | Lapsed           | 1500.75       | 80         | 30               |
| ...         | ...              | ...           | ...        | ...              |

## ⭐ Bonus Challenges

If you finish the main task, try these:

- **Unit Testing:** Write `pytest` tests for your `DataTransformer` class.
- **Logging:** Add a proper `logging` module to your pipeline to log info and error messages.
- **Separate Reports:** Create a separate `report.csv` for each product category.
